## 🏫 Overview

The **BAUST Student Portal** is a fully functional, secure, and mobile-friendly academic management system built for the students and faculty of BAUST. The platform replaces scattered Facebook posts, WhatsApp messages, and offline paperwork with one organized digital solution.

The system delivers **role-based access**, ensuring that each user — Super Admin, Class Admin (CR), or Student — can only view and manage the content relevant to their department or class.

## 🎯 Why We Built This (Motivation)

Important academic information was scattered across Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, emails, and paper notices. Students kept missing deadlines. CRs had to manually message everyone repeatedly.

We solved this by creating **one official digital hub** where every class can manage everything in an organized, private system.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Provide a **central, class-specific dashboard**
* Build a secure registration & login system with verification
* Protect class data with strict admin roles
* Automate communication with email notifications
* Make the portal accessible on both desktop & mobile
* Provide students with instant access to all academic materials in one place

## 🔍 Gap Analysis

No existing system at BAUST offered:

* Class-level privacy
* Payment approval workflow
* Automated academic communication
* Result publishing with instant email alerts
* CR-managed student sections
* Integrated question bank + resources + routines

The BAUST Student Portal fills all these gaps.
